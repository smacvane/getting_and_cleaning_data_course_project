	• The code book, codebook.md, describes the variables, the data, and transformations that were performed.
	• The R script, run_analysis.R, performs the following 5 steps:
		○ Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
		○ Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
		○ Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
		○ Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
		○ From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
	• The text file, tidydata.txt, is the exported final data table.
